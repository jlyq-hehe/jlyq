     <p>After the sucide of Sakura Ogami, Alter had been found in a hidden room within the storage closet of the 2nd floor boyâ€™s bathroom, where it had been placed a mere night before by Makoto Naegi and Kyoko Kirigiri in order to access the network. It was crushed by an excavator repeatedly, being turned into a mere pile of garbage. </p>
